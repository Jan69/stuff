this is a simple roller-selector
not much to say, arrow keys up-down to move,
the "selection" part is trivial to add, but I've not bothered yet
you can change the palette, right now defaults to 256color
and if you hold down the keys it will probably "lag"
lag is expressed as not being able to catch up with your input,
and as such, stepping through the input queue slower than you input new directions

I have no idea if it even is possible to somehow empty that input queue in a reasonably posix way
(the "non-posix" stty modes would be allowed here)
